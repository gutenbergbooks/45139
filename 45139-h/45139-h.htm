<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The booklets "Mental Nuts" and "A Book of Maxims" have
met with so much favor I have decided to try again. I submit
this little effort to those young and old who desire information
and suggestions on the subject, in the form of a "first step" or
introduction, for those who would learn to invent.</p>

<p>Though it is entirely a subject for the deepest study, I favor
a personal talk, digressing at times in an effort to interest and
instruct, to enliven and cheer. I see little hope for the casual
reader. "As ye sow so shall ye also reap." My faith rests in the
careful, persevering student. I sincerely hope that as a whole
the effort may prove helpful to many. As to the future, may
you all realize.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Invention is the fountain source of material progress. It
would indeed be a fruitless effort to try to express in adequate
language its wondrous possibilities and practical worth to mankind.
Its field of action surpasses all others. It is most apparent
in our daily walks of life. Every human effort owes it homage.
The fame of many inventors has encircled the earth. They have
been feted and honored in many ways, their names indelibly inscribed
on the roll of the earth's greatest men. Fortune and
fame have been showered on them with a lavish hand, and yet
little or no effort is made to direct thought into this vast and
unlimited field for study, that people may learn to invent. The
whole subject is left quite in the dark. It is on the go-as-you-please,
hit-and-miss plan. People become inventors by mere
chance, and are viewed as possessing a special gift of nature. I
hold that invention is just as tangible as any of the sciences and
can just as well be taught. The human mind is naturally inventive.
The trend will improve and grow or it will wilt and
die, according to the attention it receives. To learn to invent we
should apprentice ourselves, as it were, to the inventor, take up
his invention and study the original lines of his thought, as the
young artist studies the master work. First learn to imitate, and
the creative thought will follow and develop. I shall be content
to confine my effort to the simplest forms of devices I can call to
mind, a first step. But don't mistake nor be discouraged. To
the average man and the particular people to whom I hope this
pamphlet will appeal the small and simple devices are the cream
of the field. They are easily handled, quickly turned, and many
pay fabulous sums. Oftentimes the idea will flit before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
mind like a will-o'-the-wisp or its zephyr-like touch is not realized.
I believe many people have experienced a semi-consciousness
of the presence of opportunity and allowed it to pass unheeded
by, that had they taken it up intelligently and properly
studied and developed it they would have become famous.</p>

<p>We should inform and prepare ourselves. Be ready to act
on the slightest intimation. "There is a tide in the affairs of men
which, taken at the flood, leads to fortune; omitted, all the voyage
of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries."</p>

<h2>LEARN TO INVENT</h2>

<h3>SMALL TALK.</h3>


<p>Since we will interest ourselves in the very small affairs that
hang like a great cloud of fringe on the science of invention, I
think it well to make a note of some of the bright little things
that have been brought forth. Many of these little mites have
proven to be veritable gold mines to the fortunate originator or
patentee. They are too numerous to classify. They appear so
very simple, embodying but a single thought, we naturally associate
"'luck." Indeed, many did come to mind uninvited, but it
was to an observing mind, a thinking mind. If we desire to participate
in and avail ourselves of these wondrous opportunities
we must observe and think.</p>

<p>The dents on the old tin tobacco boxes, one on the box, the
other on the lid, placed to register with and thus secure it when
closed, was certainly very simple.</p>

<p>It is said a man was sewing and the needle would often
slip off the end of the thimble when he would attempt to push it
through. He became vexed and struck the thimble a blow on
the end with a hammer. It was first convex, but the blow from
the hammer made it quite flat on the end. Upon renewing the
sewing he found the thimble worked splendidly; the needle did
not slip. He became interested and finally took out a patent for
a thimble with a concave end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly, to any one who would attempt to get up a
machine to do sewing it would appear as a mere matter of force
of circumstance to use a needle with the eye in the point, since
necessarily the other end would be attached to the machine.</p>

<p>The return ball, in homely language a wooden ball with a
rubber string fastened to it, was certainly simple enough; also
the metal toe cap formerly extensively used on children's shoes
to prolong their wear.</p>

<p>The little wheels on the end of the pole on the trolley cars
would have been a bonanza were it not that the introduction of
the trolley system was so slow. The seventeen years for which
patents are granted passed by before the system became in general
use. This slowness to become general has ruined many
grand opportunities. It is a fact to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Many successful inventors have had their hopes blasted at
times by the apathy of the people in adopting their inventions in
time for them to reap their just reward. While the inventor naturally
and perforce must lead, he should be discreet, and not go
so far ahead that he cannot get the people to follow. Some
matters must be approached gradually.</p>

<p>The little ball fastening so common on our money purses is
a gem. It would be rare indeed to provide any other device to
take its place, it is so convenient, simple and practical. A fastener,
to be a success, must make a noise in closing; it becomes the
signal to the mind that the work is properly done.</p>

<p>The hook and eye "see that hump" was simple enough, but
I fancy it required a splendid campaign of advertising and business
push to get it to the front and make it pay.</p>

<p>Many inventions are virtually lost because they are not properly
pushed. My advice is, if you have an invention and are not
situated properly to push it, sell it. Experience leads me to
observe that we constantly change our views or see things differently.
Some things look good to-day and later we do not think
well of them, and vice versa, other things improve and grow in
our estimation. When an idea of a device occurs, study it; think
how it can best be made; make a drawing of it; take up every
detail and material best suited. Try to get it in the most simple
form. When, after careful consideration, you feel that you have
perfected it in your mind, have a model made and see that it
meets every requirement. If you do not sell the invention you
can contract the manufacturing and go into the business of selling,
or you can put it out on a royalty basis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>All inventors use certain mechanical principles. The same
principle is often found in many different inventions; hence, it
is well to study these principles, as the knowledge of them will
help you to perfect and bring forth your invention. In this connection
I would advise that you possess all the little novelties you
can; study them; examine them closely and ask yourself why
did he this and that. Take up each one and try to get a clear
understanding of it; practice explaining it to others and impress
the points on your mind; they may be of great service to you
some day. Many times a good idea is poorly carried out, the
mechanical arrangements are not well adapted either for performing
the work or to effect lowest cost in construction. These defects
give rise to improvements. It certainly would be a provoking
experience to obtain a grand idea and get it up in a
defective mechanical way and have someone make a simple improvement
and reap the reward. If I could control the matter
I would change the patent laws in this respect. I would foster
improvement, but I would not allow the original inventor to be
robbed of his just reward. I would not permit him to become
arrogant and dictate impossible terms, but I would see to it that
he at least got a part of his dues. If he came forward with an
original invention he would get a patent; if another man made
an improvement on his method I would give him a patent, subject
to a small royalty to the original inventor, and to continue
until the original patent expired. The matter could be judged just
as well as law cases are judged. You must duly consider the
subjects you attempt. Don't bother with perpetual motion; it
would only be a toy at best. I have no faith in a non-refillable
bottle: in all probability it would fill if it were submerged, and
particularly if a hole were drilled in it. An idea in this line is
to have a nickel or a dime blowed in the glass of the bottle; the
goods would be sold for the amount more, and the buyer would
break the bottle to get his money back. The idea seems practical,
at least so far as the fact that the broken bottle would be a true
non-refillable one. Ordinarily I do not interest in those inventions
that require to be demonstrated, as they are too expensive to
introduce. The people are generally skeptical, and they have been
so for ages. The poets of the early centuries voiced public doubt
in verse, referring to a gun, gotten up and promoted by a stock
company, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"A rare invention to destroy the crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of fools at home, instead of foes abroad;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fear not my friends, this terrible machine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They're only wounded who have shares therein."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Financial advices are all good before ten and after three.
As a rule, don't buy stocks that are glaringly advertised; they
are working hard to sell. Don't go in by the front door: stocks
of such companies can generally be bought on the outside for less
than the advertised price and are most always too high at that.
Many, indeed, would be high at the price in counterfeit money.
Vast sums and much time have been lost on various patents connected
with railroads, etc. Once in a great while one may succeed.</p>

<p>You should have a book and record your ideas as they occur;
write out enough about them to make the whole thought on the
subject clear, and preserve it for future reference. It would be
a splendid idea to write out descriptions of any little novelty you
see. State all the particulars; make your notes so that you will
clearly understand every detail at any time you refer to them:
get all the patent papers of small or simple novelties, etc., that
you can and read carefully what they say about the construction;
note what the inventor claims. I would recommend the Patent
Office Gazette. This, I am sure, will prove the most valuable
exercise you can take. They will prove practical lessons of worth
and you will gain many helpful ideas. I recently met a gentleman
from the South, who had taken out a patent on a hoe that was
used extensively in the cotton fields. The blade was extra large
and the handle was secured to the middle or central portion in a
way that when the edge of the blade in use became worn and
battered it could be turned and virtually form a new hoe.</p>

<p>In the early days of the linotype or printing machines there
were several machines being made and developed. One of the
parties took out a patent on what they called an adjuster. It was
simply a wedge, which was operated to spread the type and space
the words; and though a very simple matter, it became a most
important feature and compelled the other companies to pay a
royalty for its use.</p>

<p>I think it will be found a very valuable point to carefully
consider the subject before you rush into developing an invention.
Many things can be done, viewed as a mere mechanical
possibility, but circumstances may preclude their use. A party
labored on the idea of a device to perforate postage stamps in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
operation of canceling them. The thought finally occurred to him
to use sand in the mucilage, so that when the stamp was struck in
the usual canceling operation the sand would cut through it. I am
informed that he wrote to the Postoffice Department at Washington.
In their reply they stated that the sand would also cut the
envelope. If I desired to work on that idea I would first aim to
print the stamps with a color that would turn after it was canceled
in the usual way, using, perhaps, some acid in the canceling
ink, or I would work on the lines of a cancel to tear an embossed
stamp, but I don't think the subject worth while. I prefer articles
that sell to the many. "Little and often fills the purse."</p>

<p>All inventions originate in thought, which is often due to
casual observance. We see a man stoop on the street, pick up a
straw or splint and run it in the pipe stem. We begin to think.
His pipe became clogged; it did not draw freely; he was lucky to
find the straw; he might not always find one so readily. It is an
idea to provide for such emergency so that he will not have to depend
on the chance straw&mdash;something convenient; let me see&mdash;suppose
we take a fine wire, double and twist it, leaving a small
ring at one end. He could put it in the pipe-stem and leave it
there; it would not be large enough to close the draft. If the stem
became stopped he could pull the wire out, clean and replace it.
Now, we observed, thought obtained an idea and constructed a
device; can we improve it? We should study, ask ourselves the
questions, Does it this? Will it that? Make a sample and test
it, see that it meets the requirements, and you have an invention.
Obtain a patent, have them manufactured, and put them on the
market.</p>

<p>I do not smoke at present, and certainly do not recommend
cigarettes, but simply as an illustration of an idea: we could
gather up tobacco stems, etc., and make them into a paper to be
used as a wrapper in making the cigarette. It would come pretty
near being an all-tobacco cigarette. Why not fit the inside of the
watch case with a thin sheet revolving calendar?</p>

<p>A hollow rubber ball or spring might be fitted in the heel of
the shoe to make walking more comfortable.</p>

<p>An instrument to write with, fitted so that a ball passing over
the paper would leave the mark or ink. It would not scratch and
would wear longer than a gross of pens.</p>

<p>Bicycles may have seen their day; I often thought an automatic
pump could be arranged to keep them in prime condition.</p>

<p>Possibly a leather paint could be made to paint the soles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
one's shoes, to make them wear longer.</p>

<p>The governor on an engine is a simple idea; its function is to
control&mdash;by its use the engine is regulated. If the latter is operating
a dozen machines it is exerting a certain power; if, suddenly,
ten of the machines were stopped, the power would run the engine
at a terrific rate of speed; the governor rises and shuts off
the power, and thus controls the engine.</p>

<p>The safety valve on the boiler is also very simple; it controls
the steam pressure, allowing it to escape when it becomes too
great.</p>

<p>The wood or cold handle sad iron is exceedingly simple and
astonishingly profitable.</p>

<p>The Morse alphabet, used in telegraphing, was rather on the
puzzle order, and quite easy at that.</p>

<p>Argand had gotten up his lamp with a circular wick, in a
tube, the air thus supplying oxygen from within and without.
It was a success; his child brother playfully set a broken flask
over the flame, which was greatly improved thereby. The practical
eye of the elder Argand enabled him to note the birth of lamp
chimneys.</p>

<p>The four wire prongs to hold chimneys on lamps were crude,
simple, and very profitable.</p>

<p>A good fender for trolley cars should be made so that it could
be projected in front of the car, or drawn in within the line of the
car, bow-shaped in front and governed by springs, so that it would
yield when striking a person.</p>

<p>A mechanism might be arranged to show the next station or
street on a sign in the car. It could be operated by power taken
from the axle, though the slipping of the wheels would be bothersome.</p>

<p>The flying machine is a little too much of a wild fancy for me;
it would do for some fellow who wants to get off the earth. "It's
me for the simple life."</p>

<p>Men chew their cigars so much in smoking; it don't look a
bit neat; an oiled paper end might be worked on under the wrapper
to help the matter.</p>

<p>For cheap, machine made cigars, a toothpick might be worked
in, to be pulled out before lighting, to improve the draft.</p>

<p>"Please shut the door" became a very common saying;
finally it attracted the inventor's attention. A rope, pulley and
weight may have been first; then springs ordinarily applied came,
finally the spring was placed in the hinge and later still the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and air cushion were combined. It closes the door and prevents
it from slamming.</p>

<p>I believe in keeping fairly quiet about ideas I am working on.
But don't spend your money for a patent too quickly. Many times
patents are taken out, and instead of any danger of someone
stealing them, they can't be coaxed to buy at mere cost. Unless
it is really an important idea, it pays to get them made and see
if they will sell before you take out a patent.</p>

<p>In your notebook where you keep a record of novelties and
your ideas, from time to time, don't fail to record all costs you
can learn of and where different things can be made&mdash;the more
particular you are about these matters, the more you will improve
your ideas and ability to properly promote them. Much vexation
and lost time can be avoided in getting up inventions by being exact.
"Slipshod" won't do. It defeats many perfectly practical
ideas. The parts of a machine must be shaped and fitted to a
nicety; "whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well."</p>

<p>It seems to me there is no end to improvement. I heard of
a Yankee who was traveling in England. He was somewhat of
a blower; no matter what he saw or heard of he claimed they had
the same thing in America much more improved. The Englishmen
could not stand it, so they thought they would get the best
of the Yankee. They told him of a wonderful machine, the most
complete ever built. A hog was driven in at one end and came
out a cooked sausage at the other. The Yankee took it calmly
and said yes, they had it in America, but it was a failure until
a fellow-Yankee improved it. "Improve it? a complete machine
like that? why, impossible." "Well," said the Yankee, "he put an
attachment on so that if you did not like the sausage you simply
reversed the machine and the hog walked out again."</p>

<p>Next to the simple or single idea patents: I think the improvements
follow, and indeed many of them are exceedingly simple.
It is all right to improve old patents and new ones, when the improvement
has real merit. I want to take you over an improvement
I had patented. I secured an old trick, in the form of a tin
box three inches long, having a cap at each end. A cent would be
dropped in through an opening in the top. The central portion
was double, the outer sleeve was loose and could be pushed up and
down; a slot in its side hid by the cap would register, when
pushed up, with a slot in the inner part; by tilting the box the
cent would drop through these slots into the hand. Then the
loose sleeve had to be worked back into position so that the cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hid the slot. The operation was slow and somewhat difficult.
It occurred to me to make the box of wood and provide it with a
slanting bottom on the inside. This would lead the cent right
up to the slot, and it would come out without tilting the box;
also by using a spring it became automatic, i. e., the spring would
push it back into position.</p>

<p>The trick can be done at least five times while it is done
once with the tin box. It made an A1 trick box. It would be
a good seller on the street, but in stores they would forget how
to work it, and stores can't spare the time to demonstrate, so it
did not go well in stores. The boxes were made complete for
$4.50 per gross, sold to jobbers at $7 and to retailers at $9. They
retailed at 10 cents. They were made on a lathe and nicely
polished, packed one dozen in a box. I think in nine cases out
of ten it is best to contract with some good firm to make the
device. You will have plenty to do selling it. You can easily
get some one to make the goods, but it is not so easy to get one
who can sell them and push them properly. I tried manufacturing
and don't like it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, you can't patent an idea. You patent
the method, or device. Some patents may perforce virtually cover
the idea as a consequence of there being no alternative. A needle
for machines with the eye in the point, the wedge adjuster in
the linotype machines. Patents of that class, when good, are extra
valuable, because they can't be improved. We also can sometimes
make an article in common use by a patented machine and have
a very secure thing. I think wire nails come under this head.
Speaking of wire calls to mind the key ring; many millions have
been sold.</p>

<p>Possibly a brake could be made in the form of a wedge
suspended in front of the wheel by a chain in a way that it could
be moved so that the wheel would run on it and thus stop the
vehicle.</p>

<p>I don't know the particulars, and so I only speak in a general
way. A patent was procured on a knife with an irregular or
sawlike edge. It was recommended to cut bread, cake, etc.;
could cut without much downward pressure, which made the
bread, etc., soggy. Probably a good thing. A party patented an
improvement, making his knife with a wave edge for the same
purpose. Well, I would have compelled No. 2 to pay No. 1 a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
small royalty.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the little tugboats doing their work,
taking the big ships into dock? Do you know how they steer?
They have a propeller close up to the stern; just beyond is the
rudder. Both are in line with the centre. The turning of the propeller
throws a strong current past both sides of the rudder and
away from the tug. By turning the rudder so that the current
strikes it the vessel is forced around; it acts as though pivoted
in the centre, the ends going in opposite directions. In the early
days they tried to move the vessel by blowing wind against the
sails with a bellows stationed on the vessel. They overlooked
the reaction, and were surprised that the vessel did not move.</p>

<p>Can you construct a box having a drawer so arranged that
you could put an object in it, close and open it and have the
object disappear?</p>

<p>I frequently meet the gentleman who got up the "Donkey
Party." It certainly was amusing. The fifteen puzzle took the
country by storm. Pigs in Clover was great, but too many imitations.
The idea of printing animals on calico, so that they could
be cut, sewed and stuffed at home was no doubt profitable.</p>

<p>It was clever to shape the crackers like the oysters.  An
Elephant or Teddy Bears brand of popcorn might take. The
old sand box toys took well. They operated mechanical figures
on the hour glass principle. Millions of little wire hooks have
been sold to hang things on Christmas trees. A simple device to
revolve the tree should sell well. A small generative battery could
electric light the tree. It injures the showcase to drop the money
on it, and at times it is difficult to pick up the change. The little
porcupine-like rubber mat is handy. The cigar cutter is all
right. A revolving needle might be used to improve the draft
of the improperly made cigars; it would be more practical than
the porous plasters frequently recommended on the back of the
head for the same purpose.</p>

<p>I guess the hen, in her quill, has us all beat on toothpicks.
A man who built a large stack at his mill to get a better draft
for the fire had an eight-inch pipe leading from the fireplace. It
met an obstruction and was divided into two four-inch pipes,
one going on either side of the obstruction and thence to the stack.
When the work was completed the fire did no better than before.
The builder was much disappointed and puzzled. He could not
understand it. Can you observe what was the matter? It should
be apparent at a glance. He shut off half of the draft. An eight-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pipe is equal to four four-inch pipes. To observe you must
observe. Why do people read fiction? A lady was annoyed by
her hair coming down. She finally bent the hairpin. Her husband
patented the idea and they made a fortune. The idea of a
paragon frame for umbrellas proved a mint. Rubber dress shields,
lined, made thousands. It is said wooden shoepegs paid millions.
"Truth is stranger than fiction."</p>

<p>Toy guns are pretty old, and mama had always been nervous
over the arrows, caps, etc. I patented the harmless gun in
1883&mdash;had it fire a hollow rubber ball. I supplied the trade for
twelve years, and then sold the patent for $1,200. The invention
has paid in all probably $50,000, and the guns are for sale in the
stores as usual. In fact, all that my patent covered was the idea
of a string made fast to the rear of the plunger and extending
back to the outside, on the bottom edge of the stock, so that the
spring or plunger could be pulled back into position, instead of
using a ramrod to push it back, as in other toy guns. Perfecting
the details of this gun called for much more study than did taking
out the patent. At first the end of the plunger rod would wedge
in the barrel on striking the hollow ball. The end of the plunger
was flat, a very small portion of the ball touched it, and hence
would naturally dent and wedge. It was remedied by making the
end of the plunger concave, so that in striking the ball it would
come in contact with a greater surface and not dent. The point
where the string, which was pulled to set the spring, came out
of the stock, would split out, and we could not satisfactorily
fasten on a brass plate with an eyeletted hole. This was overcome
by boring the hole large and gluing in a round piece with
a hole through the centre. It was then cut down in the sandpapering,
and was quite unnoticeable. It worked like a charm.
It was difficult to get the hollow rubber balls at a low cost: two
cents each was quoted. They took a square piece of thin rubber,
pinched it up with the fingers, put some water in, then put cement
on the edges, placed it in an iron mold and put it in the furnace.
The water turned to steam and forced the rubber in the shape
of the mould; the vulcanizing would cause it to stay in position,
but many would leak and not shape right. The process was improved
by using tubing cut proper length and pieces punched out
of a flat sheet to fit over the ends. It was a success, and few
ever failed to properly shape. One gross was made at a time.
They cost less than one cent each. For a while $15 per thousand
was the best price quoted for the brass eagles used on the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for ornament. These were finally secured at $6, and a number of
hundred thousand were used. Seven small wood turnings were
used in each gun. The first lot of one thousand of these turnings
cost $7.50. They were made on a lathe by hand. Then they
were secured at $2.50 per thousand, done by machine, and finally
they were contracted at 70 cents per thousand. A paper tube,
painted and silver bronzed, made a good barrel. I thought these
details might interest. They are "all wool and a yard wide."
"One fact is worth a book full of theories."</p>

<p>Toys present a good field for inventors. They pay well
usually, and are easy to handle. You must hold your prices firmly;
treat all jobbers alike, no matter whether they buy one or one
hundred gross. If you favor one you offend all the rest. Be
impartial. Cities are growing so large, rents are soaring so high
and store space seems to be getting so crowded, possibly a fixture
of store shelves could be arranged on the Ferris Wheel plan and
put into position above the counter to help the situation.</p>

<p>Mucilage evaporates so fast. They have fountain pens. Can
any of you get up a fountain mucilage pen or brush? I guess
we are a little late for ink bottles and spittoons that won't spill
the contents upon upsetting. A thought in mind seems to constantly
annoy. Readers, no doubt, if they have the patience to
read the whole of this pamphlet, will possibly wonder what it is
all about. Well, they need not ponder. The student who is alive
to the subject will understand; he will take the time and allow
his thoughts to dwell on each little subject mentioned. I believe
in as much original gray matter "horse sense" and facts as circumstances
permit, that every time you bump up against it you
find something out. "Sabe."</p>

<p>Have you ever studied the philosophy of trains going around
curves. The wheels have a flange on one side and taper to the
other side. They stand on the track with the flange on the inside.
When they come to the curve, in which the outside rail is
always set higher than the inside one, and is necessarily longer,
the flange presses against it, and that wheel is running on its
largest diameter while the opposite wheel is on its smallest diameter.
This fact, together with the slipping, enables the outside
wheel to go over a greater length of rail than the inside wheel,
though both are secured rigidly to the same axle. The train has
a tendency to go straight ahead; the outside rail being higher
causes it to constantly slip a little. The bent rail keeps prying
the flange over, as it were, and the train is brought around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
curve safely.</p>

<p>Sometimes it pays to learn some things not generally considered
as being immediately connected with one's regular calling.
I heard of a noted Chinese doctor who had a very bright son who
was studying medicine at college. An epidemic set in, the doctor
was sent for and went from one case to another. He was quite
an athlete and a good swimmer. Soon the village people concluded
the doctor was the cause of all the sickness and decided
to thrash him. The doctor ran for his life, the crowd close on
his heels. Finally he came to a river, plunged in and swam to the
opposite side. No one in the crowd could swim&mdash;the doctor was
safe. He went home and the bright young son answered the
door and said, "Father, I need the money for some books at college
the teacher recommends." The father's mind was full of
thought of the experience he had just gone through, and he said,
"My son, with due respect to your teacher, I advise that you first
learn to swim; it may some day be more important than any of
your studies."</p>

<p>Do I think ladies could invent? Well, at the present moment
I feel like saying most decidedly yes. Why, you yourself
made a splendid observation. Don't you recall saying the horses
lost a great portion of their food by tossing their heads about
while eating? Well, yes, the flies are annoying, but I think there
is another reason. Well, you see they strap the full feed bag to
the horse's head. At first the adjustment is good enough, but as
the horse eats the surface of the food recedes and soon the adjustment
becomes bad. The horse can no longer reach the food, and
tosses his head about in an effort to get it. Well, we observed,
thought, and as a consequence have a problem to work out. Yes,
I think we might overcome the difficulty. Why, exactly, splendid;
we can properly adjust the springs and fasten them in the handle
or hanging straps that hold the feed bag to the horse. Then, as
he eats and the weight becomes less, the springs will cause the
bag to rise and the adjustment will be proper throughout. Yes,
that is a real invention. We are inventors. We will use a perforated
bag. Why, I think we might call it "The Automatic
Ventilated Feed Bag." The horse will thank us, and we will become
so rich. Salt cellars don't work good in damp weather&mdash;the
salt cakes. You should work out that problem by the "Think a
little" rule. A flagpole to operate the flag on the principle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
spring roller window curtain; make the political banner collapsible.
Pass tops by, too many already; besides I have been sore on them
since youth, when I tried to make one to wind up with a key and
run all day. It was a long time before I replaced my watch, the
works of which I used in that top. Did it spin? "Nope." Postage
stamp affixer. No, pass it. It may do later on when you
are more experienced. I had some dealings with a simple kind:
it looked and worked like a rubber stamp, but the moisture from
the sponge soon got in among the stamps&mdash;impractical. It should
be quite easy to make a chute wagon that would unload coal
while standing lengthwise along the curb, so as not to block the
cars.</p>

<p>Suppose you wish to cause a toy man to pass around a six-inch
circle and at the same time constantly revolve, could you
contrive to make it work by turning a crank? It is good practice
to work all puzzles and problems you find. It cultivates
reasoning and gives you splendid practice on concentrating
your thought. It makes you a close observer and becomes a
valuable asset for use in any walk of life. Some people don't
seem to notice anything&mdash;or, at least, very few things. I one time
had an amusing debate with a man. He insisted he moved his
upper jaw in eating. He proved it conclusively to himself by
biting on his finger. How many of you know the difference
between a horse and a cow in getting up? I hope a half dozen
dozen and six dozen dozen don't look alike to you. You must
get things exactly as they are in your mind; then only will you
have a true basis to reason from. Don't go through life with
the idea that everything is "about the size of a piece of chalk."</p>

<p>Many people will say to those who invent, "How did you
come to think of it? I could never think of anything." The main
trouble is they don't think at all. If they would take an interest
in things and examine them closely, study them until they can
clearly explain every detail, it would be a reasonably short time
until they would think of other things and invent. The inventor
should be sanguine and hopeful. It spurs him on and helps him
to wade through discouragement. Possibly as like produces like,
like thoughts produce like thoughts, fear thoughts produce fear
thoughts. You must have a little of the big I in you.</p>

</div>

<p>I don't mean that you should sit down and expect to invent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
by mere weight of thought. That would be like watching the
clock to see the hour pass by. I mean you should make the start.
Begin by noticing how things are done. Interest your thoughts on
the subject. Keep the matter in mind. Time will pass by pleasantly
and some morning you will find your mind engrossed with an
idea of an invention or an improvement on one, and that day will
appear the brightest in your life. The more you study over what
others have done, the sooner you will do something yourself. I
fear you won't study. Now let me see; take that trick box. In
No. 1 they tilted the box to get the cent out. Well, by tilting the
box they simply put the flat bottom on a slant and the cent slid
out. That could be improved in working by making a slanting
bottom. Again, in No. 1, after they worked the outer sleeve up
so that the openings registered and allowed the cent to slide out,
they then worked the outer sleeve back into position, so that the
side of the cap hid the slot. That work could be saved by inserting
a spring, and so you should take up each feature, learn the
reason why, and impress it on your mind. Confine yourself to
the very simple things. Later on you will take interest in the
larger ones, but at first they would likely discourage you, though
the large inventions are only a combination of simple ideas. The
telegraph sounds big. In the first place, it was simply a discovery.
The electric current magnetized the wire so that it attracted
metal, and would do so no matter how long the wire (within
reason). Now, they could not well arrange to move the magnet
over the paper to do the writing, so they thought to make it stationary
and move the paper. The machine to do this was the
biggest part of the invention. The code or Morse alphabet followed,
by arranging the dots and dashes to represent the letters.
If a massive structure were built of bricks, broad, high walls,
square and round towers, high, commanding, arched doorway,
facades, ledges, etc., you would stand and gaze in bewildering
admiration at the grand, colossal structure. Yet it is only a
combination of bricks. And what are bricks, pray? Only clay
molded into shape and baked in an oven. No man ever invented
a great machine unless he was an adept in the line of simple
things, or he engaged assistance from those who were. Don't
underrate the importance of these simple ideas. Take each one
up, consider and go over it as carefully as though it were new&mdash;your
own thought&mdash;and as though you were going to apply for
a patent on it. If you can't enthuse and work or study in earnest
on these matters you are surely on the wrong line for you. Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
off and devote your time to some other pursuit. You must be in
earnest and willing to persevere. Keep everlastingly at it.
Dabblers rarely ever succeed at anything. I saw a patented churn.
It was a plain tank and a long round handle with propeller
blades set on the end. The propeller was pushed down through
the cream. It did not revolve, and hence agitated the cream very
much. Then, when it was pulled up to the top, the propeller
revolved and the cream was scarcely moved. In going down the
propeller would move up about one inch and lock. In pulling up
it would move back and unlock. I remember the man who
patented an iron ore washer. It was a large tank affair, say
eight feet long, three feet at one end and six feet at the other.
Inside it was lined with iron plates having a flange projecting
upward. These were fastened so that the flanges formed a spiral
from the large to the small end. An axle was placed in the
centre by braces. The large end almost touched the ground;
the small end was, say, two feet above the ground. The ore
dirt was shoveled in the big end. A stream of water entered
the small end. The washer was revolved. The dirt ran out with
the water. The ore was worked by the flanges up to and fell out
of the small end. I met a party who had a patented bung for
barrels. It looked like a straight piece of round wood. I inquired,
what is the patent. He said, bungs blow out of barrels, but his
would not, because it was first made larger at one end than the
other, then by driving it through a tube it was forced equal at
each end. The original big end was marked and put in the bung
hole. The liquid would cause it to swell to its former size. It
could not blow out, and to tap the barrel it was driven in. The
shores of Lake Superior are full of fine iron ore, probably
millions of dollars worth. A party got up an electrical separator.
To reclaim the iron sounds big. Let us see. An iron cylinder,
an electrical battery or dynamo to charge and magnetize it, a long
trough with a moving belt in the bottom. The sand and fine iron
were shoveled on the belt and carried up to and fell on one side
of the revolving magnetized cylinder. The iron adhered, and
as the separator revolved it was scraped off on the other side.
Some ten years ago I wrote to a number of chewing gum firms
and proposed they make sugar-coated tablets. They did not
enthuse and I dropped the matter. To-day it forms quite a business.
About twenty-five years ago I proposed to put India-rubber
along the water line of war ships, so that when struck the hole
would close and prevent the water going in. To-day every war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ship is equipped with that idea, using cellulose instead of rubber.
So, don't give up your ideas too quickly. Become well convinced
before you drop them. During the past month I read an article
stating that the railroads required a heavier rail. I thought the
added weight might be used to make the rail alike top and bottom&mdash;a
double rail&mdash;so that when one side wore out the rail could
be turned and virtually have a new one, and it being on the
ground would save the handling in the second case. A special
shoe would secure it to the tie. First costs are often increased
to get economic results. I simply advance the idea. Any one
interested can put it in their pipe and smoke it. If any of you
use a rubber ball in the heel of the shoe to make walking comfortable
you may be able to fit a small tube and have it arranged to
ventilate the toe of the shoe. A party made a horseshoe having
a toe piece of three parts. The centre was very hard steel; the
outsides were soft. They wore down and the hard centre stuck
up. It was always sharp. He said the blacksmiths would not
handle them because it hurt their business.</p>

<p>It always seemed a good idea to make a wheel so that the
spokes formed a hub at the centre. If all the people were alive
to their needs all hats would be ventilated. The corrugated band
is a good idea, as far as it goes. It should be supplemented with
vents in sides or top. Do you know they paint ships without
brushes? Simply spray it on with an atomizer and sweep with
a suction hose. I hope it will be after my day when some of you
get up a machine to do the eating. A cannon was mounted with
mechanism to absorb the recoil and other service. A hole was
drilled through the side of the cannon about one foot from the
end or muzzle. A tube was fitted and extended rearward to the
mechanism. When the cannon was fired the pressure became
very great in the chamber, and the instant the projectile passed
the drilled hole, and until it left the gun, this high pressure or
power went through the tube and worked the mechanism at the
rear of the gun. I know hoopskirts are long out of style. Could
a flexible metal band be arranged at the bottom of pants and end
of coat sleeves, so that they need not be sewed and could be
worked to shorten or lengthen them, as desired?</p>

<p>I saw a funnel that had a wire rod running down to the
small end. A ball on the end of the rod was used to close or open
the funnel. When the bottle was full you could close the funnel,
and no more would run out of it. I don't think there is a good
nutmeg grater on the market. The price at retail should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
above 10 cents. It should have a good appearance, convenient
and practical. It should all be enclosed, fly proof and dust proof&mdash;a
sanitary grater. There is a chance to improve a match box to
hang on the wall, something that won't show the marks. You
should be alive to the difference between goods being on sale at
stores and taking hold of a specialty and pushing it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the horses are driven with slack lines, and shy
or scare suddenly. Often the driver is bothered to take up the
slack. Could you invent handles to put on the lines that could
be moved forward easily, have them grip so not to slip back
until a spring or catch released them? I don't understand why
they don't connect the shafts to the vehicle so that they could be
instantly disconnected in case the horse ran away.</p>

<p>They sell a number of popcorn roasters. One to revolve
should prove a good seller. The shaking plan is very tiresome.
Some arrangement should be put on the bootblack boy's box to
prevent the foot from slipping off. A propeller rocket could be
made to go very high. Could you make a metal frame that any
one, by using a strong manila paper, could make a pocketbook to
hold notes, bills, etc.? How do you like a wire device to be put
on rolls of ribbon to keep them from unwinding in the retail
stores? A watch might be made so that the opening and closing
of the lid would keep it wound up. I have not been inside a
school for a long time. Perhaps they have holders to prevent
the chalk crayons from breaking.</p>

<p>Did you ever cut a round piece of cardboard in a strip, say
one-half inch wide, cutting round and round to the centre, then
set it on a knitting needle, place it over the stove and see it turn?
The heat from a small wax candle should turn a Christmas tree
lamp on the same principle. Now they make wood lead pencils
that require no sharpening. The lead is loose. A slot down
the side of the pencil enables one to advance the lead as required.
Elections call forth many ideas as to the best form of balloting.
I think a very safe form of voting would be to have two large
iron boxes with mechanism and a long roll of paper, proper width,
with the ballots printed on it; a flat space or table between the
boxes; the long paper tape of ballots would be wound up on a
roller in one box and unwound into the other, the ballots to be
numbered consecutively. A voter steps up and proves his right
to vote; then he marks his vote on ballot No. 1, which shows
on the flat place between the boxes. The judges then turn a
crank. That ballot moves into the other box and the next adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ballot appears on the flat place. Such a plan would be free
from stuffing, and ought to give reasonable satisfaction. The
various styles of folding boxes are good illustrations of the single
idea inventions. Many flourishing concerns are based on same.
To be an inventor one should be a close observer. They should
make sure of just what they see. I heard of a business man who
had a very valuable horse. He left particular orders that great
care should be taken and see that the horse did not get loose and
go in the new clover field. He went off to his business, some
distance away, and soon a neighbor came at top speed and said,
"Your horse is in the clover field." The business man left his
office in great haste and ran home, where he found the horse in
the stable where he had left him. The cow had been put in the
clover field. The neighbor said he did not look so very close.
He saw an animal in the field. It seemed to have four corners,
with a leg from each corner to the ground, and thought it might
be the horse. He wouldn't make an inventor&mdash;"A left-over in
the process of nature's selection." A device to turn the sheets
of music for piano players should be worthy of study. Some
one ought to get up a paste that could be put in a tooth and
adhere. It should become hard and be lasting. Most anything
to obviate the barbarous riveting process.</p>

<p>Has it ever occurred to you the vast amount of waste going
on in putting up goods in tin packages? It presents a great field
for invention of the simple "lucky" kind. The person who hits
the right thing will become vastly wealthy. Try to devise a
shape of package that will answer and be useful after it is
emptied. Now, simply to illustrate the idea, say we put tomatoes
up in a tin cup with a lid that would serve as a cake cutter. Nice
little buckets might answer. Smoking tobacco packages ought
to answer for match boxes to hang on the wall. Come, now,
there is a fortune waiting. Who among the students will be first
to claim it? Nothing would please me more than to hear of some
one or more of you making a hit. Think. "He who would eat
the nut must crack it."</p>

<p>Some people think there have been so many patents taken
out already there is no chance to get up any more. The truth is,
no doubt, the chances are on the increase. New sciences are
being developed, as for instance, electricity, and each new machine
turns out work that enables the inventor to do something he could
not well do before. Machinery now will shape wire to any
required form; castings are greatly improved; wood turnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are cheap and in almost every imaginable shape. The inventor
of to-day has almost every possible detail want at hand, and so
he can undertake things heretofore out of reach. Naturally, as
the country grows things come into demand that were not worth
while before. Indeed, from every point of view the field seems
to broaden.</p>

<p>Suppose a two-inch tube has a one-inch hole through the
side. It is desired to cover the hole with a band, so arranged
that when the band is turned it will revolve a rod inside of the
tube. Can you reason how to do it? Grates used under boilers
for steam purposes expand when heated. When cast in one
piece the bars warp and soon wear out. A grate was patented
made in pieces; each single bar was loose; due allowance was
made for expansion. They are oval on top, broad and tapering.
They do not warp. The space between the bars widened towards
the bottom, hence the ashes would not clog. Draw an end view
of such bars; the idea will show plainly. I favor drawing to
impress thought. The matter rests with yourself. "You can
lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink."</p>

<p>Since so simple a device as an air cushion will render the
fall of an elevator harmless, there should be something doing
with trains of cars. No telescoping. Who will quiet the awful
noise of the trolley car, particularly in cities? Overhead they
might slide the cars to advantage, using a cog motor on third
rail. Method is a species of invention. It lends force to action.</p>

<p>When we look at the watch we must make a mental calculation
to state the time. I heard of a watch that had three circular
openings in the front case, one on each side and one on the bottom;
the latter showed the second hand. The one on the left
showed the hour, and on the right the number of minutes past the
hour were shown. If it were twenty minutes past ten we would
see ten and twenty. There was no mental calculation required.</p>

<p>No doubt you have all seen the little egg separator, a circular
piece of sheet metal having a concave centre with little slots near
the top of the concave portion. It is placed on a cup. The egg
broken and contents placed in the separator, the white runs
through the slots into the cup and the yolk remains in the separator.</p>

<p>A good ink tablet should be a good thing. They certainly
would be a great convenience, and should do for fountain pens
too. I have often thought that chairs are not made right. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you lean back the front part of the seat rises and it tends to
stop circulation in the limbs. Could the seat part be so hinged
or arranged that the front portion would not rise, or would it
answer to simply have the back hinged?</p>

<p>The stem wind on the watch was a very simple thought, and
should have been forced on the mind every time the key was lost.
"Necessity is the mother of invention."</p>

<p>I advise all who have any idea of inventing to practice drawing.
It is an excellent practice and makes one a close observer.
In thinking of subjects combining several movements or features
the drawing clinches them; oftentimes the idea will slip the mind,
and puzzle as we will we can't recall it at the desired time. "Now
you shall wish, but wish in vain to call the fleeting words again."
When you draw it it is there. You can leave it and take up any
part you wish to consider. There is a lot of studying to do to
equip yourself well for inventing. The better you are equipped
the better your chances. But you should look upon the work as
a pleasure. Then each thing you learn will please. I don't believe
in scolding the learning into people. We should aim to make
learning pleasant and agreeable. I know the subject is dry to
many. I don't wish to weary, remember.</p>

"It's pennies for labor and dollars for thought."<br />
</div>

<p>A contractor was building a pier at the seashore. When he
tried to drive the piles down into the sand they would continually
bounce up. He became very much discouraged; he was completely
puzzled. It baffled his wits. A gentleman from the West
was visiting at the resort. He became very deeply interested in
the little clams. He was amused to see how quickly they could
go down in the sand. He visited the pier and learned of the contractor's
troubles. He sought him and advised that a hose be
attached to the pile and force a stream of water ahead of it as
it was driven down. The idea worked very satisfactorily. Observation.
Yes, ideas are good things. A cow had fallen in a well
that was being dug. The neighbors gathered about the well,
which was ten feet deep. No one could suggest a means to
rescue the cow. An old darkey passing by was attracted by the
crowd. He looked down into the well and saw the cow apparently
unhurt. He said, "Let's git her out." "How?" they sang
in chorus. "Why, jist shovel de sand back inter de well; she'll
keep on top."</p>

<p>During the siege of Paris they wrote letters and reduced
them in size until they looked like mere dots to the naked eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
They were then sent out on pigeons and magnified to the original
size. That is possibly the basis of a freak thought. Suppose a
$1 bill was placed on a hillside; we go a distance away and take
a photograph of one mile square of the hillside, having the bill
exactly in the centre. Say the photograph is one foot square.
Now we cut off one and three-quarter inches all the way around
the picture, leaving say one-half of the same. Then we enlarge
this to one foot square and repeat until the foot square picture
shows say ten feet square of hillside with the bill in plain view
in the centre. If that could be done we could examine the moon
and planets too, very closely.</p>

"One science only can one genius fit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So vast is art, so narrow human wit."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Probably the most uncertain feature of a majority of patents
is, will the people buy them? The theory of most patents is
plausible enough. But often the practice or fact is very doubtful.
The public seem to be whimsical and act as the spirit moves
them, oftentimes without rhyme or reason; things become a fad
or are turned down. They spring up and die like a flower. There
is no rule. You must take your chance. It is a natural stumbling
block. You must be sanguine to invent and cautious to keep off
of wrong leads. Take the matter philosophically. Don't allow
it to irritate. You can counsel with practical people and those
whom you expect to use your device. Feel your way the best
you can. When ready, take your plunge, and be satisfied to settle
the matter, either as a success or failure. If the latter, make
your bow, "Nor with weight of words offend the ear."</p>

<p>There seems to be no rule; they come and go. The first time
I saw a match with the handle end fire proofed, so not to burn
the finger, it looked good. I thought all matches would be made
that way. Now I scarcely ever see one.</p>

<p>The little brass-like boxes with a spring lid and about sixty
matches, all for one cent at retail, tells the story of cheap labor
by machinery. I saw a match box in the form of a house. The
low chimney in the centre of the roof was as long as a match
and very narrow; a flat piece with a gutter in the top edge filled
the inside of the chimney. The house would be pulled up and
then pushed down; always a match would be in the guttered
end of the piece in the chimney. I did not examine it, but it no
doubt had a slanting bottom on the inside. The piece in the
chimney was stationary. The house would rise high enough so
that the top of the guttered piece would be at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
slanting sides. The matches would roll over it, and one would
lodge in the guttered top. When the house was pushed back it
was at the top of the chimney, ready for use. It embodies an
idea, and so I will give it. Some houses become infested with
active insects, to the very great annoyance of the occupants. If
you ever happen to have the occasion, put a few sheets of sticky
fly paper on the floor at night; place a small piece of raw meat
in the centre of each. They will all be there in the morning.
They hop for the meat and linger on the paper. Stop laughing
and think. Suppose you had no sticky fly paper nor molasses,
would you think to try a plate with water on it and the meat in
the centre? Thinking how to substitute one plan for another is
good exercise. Look out when you do it, or you will invent.
The gyroscope top is certainly very peculiar in its movements.
It is an enigma to science. It is proposed to run a car on a single
rail by having two gyroscopes mounted within the car. In rowing
a boat the position is such that the power does not continue
in full to the extreme end of the stroke. Possibly the blade
could be pivoted to the oar, so that at the best point in the stroke
for the purpose it would press a spring, which would release
itself at the end of the stroke to advantage.</p>

<p>The elbow for stove pipes was a fine idea, also the spring
rollers for window curtains. The mail box in use is good.
Indeed, it should be quite natural for a person to enthuse. I
patented a child's riding stick, hollow wheels at one end, horse
head with moveable jaw at other. Can you reason how to make
the jaw work? No doubt you rode on summer trolley cars and
pushed up and pulled down the curtains. But do you know how
they are constructed? The curtain is attached to a spring roller,
and has an iron tube on the end. Two wire cords, one on either
side of the frame, are fastened at the top. Each passes through
the tube and is fastened again at the bottom. Thus the cords
cross in the tube, which can be pushed up, the spring roller taking
up the slack curtain; or it can be pulled down, the curtain unwinding.
If you will only observe closely you will see ideas carried
out on every hand. When you come to invent the knowledge of
them will give you confidence and help you very much. But it
will not suffice to simply read of them. You must study, learn
and impress the principle on your mind. It is learning, not reading,
that counts. It has always seemed queer to me that so many
ideas spring up and flourish for a while, then die and are forgotten.
Many good ideas for the personal benefit of the buyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
don't seem to go at all. If an article pleased one generation, why
not the next? It is so in many things and not so in many others.
Judgment is required to distinguish standard from transient. A
life preserver, say of oiled goods, with a spring inside, flat, the
size of a plate when operated, three feet long and able to float a
person. Convenient fasteners for room doors with poor locks,
burglar alarms and portable fire escapes, all worth their weight
in gold when required. A few poles and strands of wire, an
electrically controlled carriage and an operator would drop a life
preserver every few feet of the bathing surface. They are all
good subjects for the people in the troubles, but you would go to
bed hungry trying to sell the goods. Two wire cables across the
street from the big hotels, to operate a draw bridge, at times
would save hundreds, as would a tunnel from amusement places.
Steel cars would prevent the terrible fires when wrecked, and
save many lives. It seems the people want something to eat, wear
or to amuse for their money. It has been a much mooted question,
and as it involves an idea it may not be amiss. How to make
fire from wood: You would get very tired rubbing two pieces
of rotten wood together. Select a dry, well-seasoned block; nick
or deeply dent the surface with a sharp stone. Provide an arrow-like
stick, and a bow and string much like the bow and arrow.
Stand the arrow-like stick in the dented surface of the block.
The bow has the string fast at each end. Make one wrap of the
string around the arrow, which you steady with one hand and
work the bow back and forth with the other. Mechanics would
call it a fiddle drill. The arrow-like stick will turn rapidly. The
friction will create a dust-like, fibrous mess, which will soon burn.
Then blow and have a flame.</p>

<p>Make a currycomb with wire teeth: Have a sheet of metal
proper shape perforated to receive the wire teeth, and rest at the
bottom of the brush. After cleaning the horse pull the metal
sheet up, thus cleaning the comb. For a window sash without
weights follow the trolley curtain. If a stirrup had an open
bottom, save a small cleet on each side to rest the foot on, in case
the rider was thrown the foot would turn and come out.</p>

<p>I don't believe in the strenuous life. It is the "happy medium"
that appeals to me. We must have time to think. I don't
mean to hesitate. We should think in advance as far as possible.
Think, so that you will know better what to do. Try not to
become confused; act with good judgment. A doctor was expecting
a load of hay. On returning home at noon he noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a load upset in front of his gate. A boy with a fork in his hands
looked bewildered. The doctor inquired and was told the hay
was for him. "Ah, well," he said to the boy, "come in and have
some dinner." "Oh, indeed, sir, I can't; my father would not
like it. I must move the hay." "Oh, yes," said the doctor, "come."
The boy was hungry and willing, but insisted his father would
not like it. Finally he reluctantly yielded. But he ate so fast the
doctor cautioned him in vain. He would reply, "I am sure father
won't like it." Finally the doctor asked, "Where is your father?"
"Why," said the boy, "he's under that load of hay."</p>

<p>I noticed in a paper that the Government desired a device
to secure packages of letters in transit from one place to another.
They use string, and it costs over $200,000 per year. A
billion of packages are tied up annually. At first glance, considering
security, etc., I rather think a telescopic box would be
best. But the cost, wear and tear, extra weight in freight all act
to make the box impracticable. Indeed, if the matter is to be
governed by cost, I advise our dear old Uncle Sam to stick to his
string. The common shipping tag which has the washer-like
piece of cardboard to reinforce the tie hole is simple and good.
It is cheap and stronger, indeed, than the metal eyelets.</p>

<p>The ball and socket fastener used on gloves, suspenders and
many other things is very good. It fell in the lap of a Frenchman.</p>

<p>A great variety of fasteners to hold sheets of paper together
have a large sale. In most all cases they aim to hold the paper
without puncturing it.</p>

<p>The name Uneeda was coined, tied fast to a biscuit and became
famous.</p>

<p>S. T. 1860 X was an oldtimer. I believe it meant "sure
thing in ten years from 1860."</p>

<p>I think a good ash sifter could be made with a box, say two
by three feet, and a cylindrical sieve on an axle with a crank
handle. The sieve to be provided with a door or lid, the ashes
put in and the sieve revolved. The operation should be easy.
It was a good idea to make circular zinc pieces to put under
stoves; also the circular pieces used in pipe holes to close them
in summer. The little bell-shaped guards hung from the ceiling
to protect it from the gas jets was good, very simple and quite
natural. The little burners on the gas fixtures are fine.</p>

<p>I met a gentleman who was blind. He took out a patent for
a handle for a scrub brush. It could be attached and detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
at will. The barn doors hung on wheels on a track was a good
job; also the gates that open when the team approaches. The
lawn mower was not slow. Games are a very uncertain field to
work in, though some of the standard games have been very
profitable. They must be gotten up in elaborate manner, and as
a rule must be well advertised. Many little puzzles have paid
well, but they are invariably greatly exaggerated. The matters
that come under the head of copyright are, I think, a good field
to work in. The money success of these things depends principally
on how well they are handled. There are many ways to
make sales, many channels to work in. I am of the opinion that
a large per cent. of inventors would do better to put their inventions
out on royalty or sell. I am sure those who have invented
will do so again and again if they are not too busily engaged
otherwise. Hence I claim it best, generally speaking, to sell or
place on royalty, and then invent something else. Inventing is
really a profession&mdash;so is manufacturing.</p>



<div class='center'>"Let the cobbler stick to his last."</div>

<p>The strenuous life, like baby's suit, is soon outgrown. Then
what to do becomes important. I think every city of fair size in
the country should have a trades exchange. A man or woman
opens a store and announces they will receive goods of all descriptions
to sell or exchange, give a descriptive receipt for the
goods, charging, say ten per cent. for services, when sold or exchanged.
You can make a good white soap for say two cents
per pound; put it up in one and a quarter pound cakes and sell
direct to the consumer for five cents&mdash;give premiums for your
wrappers. Take a contract to increase the circulation of your
country or town paper; then visit the people, prepare an article
on the city or town, and write up sketches of those who subscribe.
Mail order business will pay fairly well from any point if you
deal right. Never sell anything unless it is worth the money, and
don't introduce any fake schemes. Get some good novelties,
household articles, books, etc.; select good leaders to advertise,
and when you make a sale enclose circulars of the other goods;
soon you can have a catalogue. Study the papers you advertise
in; there are many quacks&mdash;you can tell them by the character
of their advertising. Public catalogues soon become too common;
also you should handle the goods you sell. Then you can control
the matter better. Lists of names are generally drummed too
much before you get them. Once you begin to advertise you will
get informed of live papers and live goods to push.</p>

<p>Yes, the woods are full of them. The future inventions will
rival those of the past. You should prepare and cast your net.

<p>Finished! Don't say you do not like it. We can find reasons
to like anything. It all depends on the way we view it. I heard
of an Irishman who imbibed too freely in a Western town and
was ridden through the place on a rail. The people lined the
streets and cheered lustily. After it was all over some one asked
him what he thought of it. "Be gorra," says he, "if it wasn't fur

<p>If this little pamphlet turns out to be a cue which directs
new thought into the vast unlimited field of invention, its mission
will be filled. Possibly some day the subject will be taught
in the schools; possibly those scholars will be the most practical
people on the earth; possibly their influence in the land will wield
a mighty Niagara of power.</p>
